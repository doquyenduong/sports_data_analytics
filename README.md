# sports_data_analytics

An individual project for the module "Sport data analytics" at HSLU. The goal of this project is to plot __various graphs__ in the topic of FIFA World Cup. This is my second project with R (tidyverse). 

## Motivation
Football or soccer is ranked number 1 in the top 10 list of the World’s most popular sport with approximately 3.5 billion fans according to Top-end Sports. There are numerous champions and competitions for football globally. Among those, FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious tournament in the world. Every four years, there are 32 nations with soccer male teams competing for the champion cups. Started in 1930, World Cup is one of the most influential sports events, where the whole world’s eyes are keeping on.

Inspired by the lively and enthusiastic vibes of the World Cup, the study attempts to investigate past data to visualize interesting rankings, trends and patterns on nations, players, attendance, host countries and goals. Since data visualization is the focus, we want to walk you through our meaningful graphs and to tell you an insightful story through our analysis.

## Programming language
R with tidy verse focus
